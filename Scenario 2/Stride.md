  root((Malicious Data Injection))
    Spoofing
      Attacker impersonates legitimate data source
      Mitigation: Validate data sources, use HTTPS
    Tampering
      Attacker modifies scraped data
      Mitigation: Validate and sanitize scraped data
    Repudiation
      Attacker performs actions without trace
      Mitigation: Enable logging and monitoring
    Information Disclosure
      Sensitive data exposed via malicious content
      Mitigation: Encrypt data at rest, use access controls
    Denial of Service
      Malicious content disrupts scraping pipeline
      Mitigation: Implement rate limiting, monitor for anomalies
    Elevation of Privilege
      Malicious scripts exploit downstream systems
      Mitigation: Use least privilege, monitor for unusual activity
